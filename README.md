# Coordinates-of-Philippine-Schools

The `phil_schools_coords.R` contains the code for matching the school name and address with the coordinates from Google Maps using the `ggmap` package. The spreadsheet used (`DepEDSchools with Missing GPS Data - Sheet1.csv`) can be downloaded from this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuQNYxUj30Thu29V6PyZZelYBnsJazo5ZZEc0hN_5Ww/edit#gid=0).

Make sure to check the matches for impossible and wrong values (e.g. negative long and lat values)
